# Variables and Constants in C++

### C++ Variables : 

- In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

- To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). For example,

```cpp
int age = 14;
```

- Here, `age` is a variable of the int data type, and we have assigned an integer value 14 to it.

- The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.

```cpp
int age = 14;   // age is 14
age = 17;       // age is 17
```
